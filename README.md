# Infusing a culture of open science within the community of researchers at the Zuckerman Institute
## Open Life Science project - from January to April 2020 
### Vision statement
I am working with my mentor Mateusz Kusak and my Open Life Science cohort to create a document outlining the strategy to infuse a culture of open science within Columbia University’s Zuckerman Institute, so that its community of neuroscientists can thrive in a healthier, truly collaborative environment of openness and transparency that can lead to transformative science. (Based on the Mozilla lesson “Intro to Open Leadership”)
