# Milestone 1
Assessing the ZI climate: where we are, what we need and where we want to go with our open science practices and policies
What do people know about open science and what do they need?

## Tasks
a) Do ~10 (?) 1:1 meetings with community members chosen at random, to assess how the community feels about open science (general value, practices). Questions to guide the 1:1 convos:
- inclination to deposit code/software openly (open source license)
- inclination to deposit datasets in open repositories
- inclination to publish own manuscripts as preprints (what % of your papers are on the arxiv?)
- consideration of other people’s preprints (do you red/cite/review them?)
- inclination to publish own peer-reviewed manuscripts as open access
- new: are you aware of funders’ expectations/have you taken any measures to make your data FAIR findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable?
- do your projects have a data management plan
- do you cite software you use? do you make your software citable?
(for inspiration about questions to ask, see page 12 of https://osf.io/preprints/metaarxiv/ecgb5)

b) Produce a General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) plan (essential for all the milestones)
- [ ] investigate laws, policies, and rules that cover data collection, retention, of this project’s participants    
- [ ] make our General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) plan
- [ ] share it transparently

# Milestone 2

Identifying and engaging critical stakeholders among the ZI community of researchers and leadership who will be involved in this project following open leadership best practices

## Tasks
c) Identify community members who already publish preprints and/or code openly and interview them. Have ~10 1:1 conversations: 
- to learn what motivates them to adopt open science practices (mix of PIs and postdocs)
- to ask them how the ZI could further support them
- to ask them to be community champions/advocates for this cause by:
    being consultants to create programmatic content (both events and communications);
    helping us advertise events by signing email announcements, introducing events, etc;
    participating in events

d) In parallel. Identify community members who are skeptical about preprints and/or open code and interview them. Have ~10 1:1 conversations to: 
- to learn their motivations
- to ask them how the ZI could further support them

e) Use data from c) and d) to create persona profiles and a mountain of engagement based on these: define how different stakeholders might approach open science:
- What is the best way to pitch open science initiatives to them?
- What incentives can we offer them to persuade them to adopt open science practices?
- At what different levels might stakeholders engage with the org on these topics?
- What works and what doesn’t work for different groups of participants?
- How do participants move from one engagement level to another? What happens when they get stuck between them?
- How can we systematize the ways we recognize participants and invite them to deeperlevels of engagement over their lifetime in the community?

f) Present the vision for this project and data from e) to CEO to make the case for why we need to develop programmatic content around open science, and support in general, as an institute, an open science culture. Goal: obtain CEO’s buy-in, in the form of behavior modeling and funding

# Milestone 3

Exploring pathways for dissemination of open science best practices, and selecting the most suitable one for my organization

## Tasks
g) Find good examples of communities that have run engaging programs about open science:
- [ ] connect more with Elisenda Bonet-Carne [OSCBa (Open Science Community Barcelona)|@bonetcarne] and Cass (Oxford), whose project vision is similar to mine
- [ ] learn from the UTDelft model of Data Champions and Data Stewardship, and from the Utrecht model
- [ ] consult with community champions about creative ways to engage audiences about open science: move away from the lecture/presentation model and find someone who could lead workshops about several aspects of open science (case studies usually capture the imagination)
- [ ] read https://open-science-training-handbook.gitbook.io/book/ (The focus of the new handbook is not spreading the ideas of Open Science, but showing how to spread these ideas most effectively)
- [ ] programs we could run:
- Data Management-focused (too big overlap with ReaDI program?)
- General introduction to research data management 
- How to use repositories for data sharing and searching for existing datasets 
- Data management plan preparation
- Data backup and storage solutions  → collaborate with Research Computing department at ZI
- Data ownership and licensing → explore overlap with ReaDI program and CU libraries, and the “legal strategy” for monetization related to new developed software
- Lab Notebook review (within lab group; Like Fokkens, University of Amsterdam)
- “ReproHack” https://reprohack.github.io/reprohack-hq/ During a ReproHack, participants attempt to reproduce published research of their choice from a list of proposed papers with publicly available associated code and data (Anna Krystalli - https://annakrystalli.me) → Coding-focused
- Pizza 4 Python (https://pizza4python.com/about-pizza4python/) → Community engagement-focused
- Data café / Open Science Café informal drop in sessions or more formal panel discussions
- Lecture/panel discussion on funders’ requirements for data management and sharing
- Working with confidential data (personally identifiable; commercially sensitive etc.) → explore overlap/collaboration with other CU offices
- Amsterdam Science Park Study Group - https://www.scienceparkstudygroup.info/

# Milestone 4

Making the Open Science initiative at the Zuckerman Institute sustainable: distributed and shared leadership

## Tasks
h) Empower contributors (aka co-developers) to become leaders of the programmatic content: mentor community members up to the highest level  of the *mountain of engagement [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oy8qp_qhMalIVNu5Fx_1yv5SsO0CWAVQv8vC_9L2n1Y/edit#]” 
- [ ] write a clear documentation for the project and the process of community members  involvement
- [ ] create a tutorial to explain how members can be contributors (depending on how much time you have)
- [ ] organize collaboration events
- [ ] establish a communication platform to bring contributors together (ex.: Slack)

i) Highlight and celebrate contributions 
- [ ] establish incentives for participation: a reward mechanism
- [ ] properly feature contributors on internal and external communication platforms
